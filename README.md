<h1>RSA Encryption Algorithm</h1>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>This project implements the RSA encryption algorithm in Python. RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that enables secure communication by generating a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be freely distributed and used to encrypt messages, while the private key remains confidential and is used to decrypt received messages.</p>
<p>The security of RSA encryption is based on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<li>Key generation: Generates a pair of keys (public and private) based on two randomly chosen prime numbers.</li>
<li>Encryption: Allows encryption of messages using the public key.</li>
<li>Decryption: Allows decryption of messages using the private key.</li>
<li>Basic example usage: Demonstrates the key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.</li>
